# Personal macOS scripts for faster setup

The main.sh installs Homebrew, restores config files from the configs folder to the user folder then installs apps with brew.

## Instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/Jaycedam/macos-setup.git
cd macos-setup
sh main.sh
```

Change the terminal font for the MesloLGS NF, then restart the terminal.

## Update configs

The `backup.sh` script updates the config backup with the current ones.
